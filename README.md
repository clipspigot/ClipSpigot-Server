ClipSpigot
===========

An enhanced Spigot-API and Bukkit implementation.
Forked from PaperSpigot which is fork of Spigot which is fork of Craftbukkit, offering
the most optimalized and stable server run with extra features that can be never introduced
in craftbukkit!

Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out and install [Spigot-API](http://github.com/SpigotMC/Spigot)
    * *Note*: this is not needed as the repository we use has Spigot-API too, but you might have a newer one (with your own changes :D)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean package`
